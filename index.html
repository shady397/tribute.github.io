                <h2>Einstien of 21st Century</h2>
                <p><b>Stephen Hawking</b> was a renowned theoretical physicist and cosmologist. He was known for his groundbreaking work on black holes and the origins of the universe. He was also a prolific author, writing several popular books on science and cosmology, including "A Brief History of Time," which became a bestseller. Despite being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neuron disease at the age of 21, Hawking lived an incredibly productive life and continued to work and publish papers until his death in 2018. He was widely considered to be one of the most brilliant minds of his generation and his contributions to science and cosmology continue to be widely celebrated.</p>
                <p>Stephen Hawking was often referred to as the "Einstein of our time" or "the new Einstein" due to his groundbreaking work in theoretical physics and cosmology, as well as his ability to make complex scientific concepts accessible to a lay audience. Like Einstein, Hawking made significant contributions to our understanding of the universe and the fundamental laws that govern it, particularly in the areas of black holes and the origins of the universe. Additionally, both scientists were known for their ability to think outside the box and come up with new and innovative ideas that challenged the scientific community's understanding of the world. Furthermore, both Einstein and Hawking were recognized for their ability to explain complex scientific ideas to a general audience.
